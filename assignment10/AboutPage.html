      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m a multi-disciplinary creative from Chicago with a passion for graphic design, illustration, and sound design.
        With over 10 years of experience using Adobe Creative Suite—Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and
        more—I've honed my skills in crafting visually compelling designs, including flyers, billboards, posters, and
        brochures. My expertise extends to sound design and music production with FL Studio and Adobe Audition, enabling
        me to bring both visual and auditory experiences to life.
        I hold an Associates of Applied Science in Graphic Design and an Associates of Arts from Triton College, where I
        was also a proud member of Phi Theta Kappa honors society. My professional journey includes serving as the
        Co-Media Relations Director for Illinois State's Black Student Union, where I had the opportunity to lead
        creative projects that reached a wide audience.
        What inspires me most is the work of other artists—especially those who embrace vibrant, expressive design and
        bold colors. My love for design is deeply intertwined with my admiration for music, particularly the innovative
        sounds of Childish Gambino. I approach each project with a methodical mindset: analyze, then act. Whether I'm
        bringing ideas to life through graphics or sound, I aim to create aesthetically pleasing, impactful designs that
        communicate effectively and resonate with viewers.
        Outside of my creative work, I’m passionate about anime, video games, superheroes, cartoons, hip-hop, R&B, and
        manga. These interests not only fuel my creativity but also influence the way I approach design—always with an
        eye toward storytelling, emotion, and vibrancy.
